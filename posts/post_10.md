In you case you have never heard of **Benediction**, take a listen to their new album **scriptures**, and hopefully you won't
break your bones, or have a concussion. Oh the militancy of their precision attack on your senses.

These guys are legit, raing maniacs. With precision skills, to get you seriously motivated to get shit done. They have been around since the early 90s and originally hail from the UK, but now the group is spread out all across Europe. Seriously it is some of the best metal I have heard in quite a while, and with really good tried but true vocal style that I always get off on. Guitars are like an Armored assault along the Eastern front with your veins full of biphetamine.

No joke. The lyrics are really well written to boot. Not that it matters but these dudes are not young, but they rage like [**High Command**](https://southernlord.com/band/high-command/). If you are a fellow **Hesher** like me looking for something you have not heard before check out Benediction. They won't dissapoint you I promise.

On a final note all of their album art just crushes it, and make no mistake about it, packaging and album art always matters.
Get their stuff on vinyl if you can.

I get a serious early Sepultura vibe off of them, but they make it their own unique flavor. Vocals are vicous.

Here are two of their newest videos. Hint: These are youtube vids, just mouse click within them. Same with the Scriptures album further up.
