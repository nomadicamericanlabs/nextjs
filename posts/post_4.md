So there are many woman that I truly admired that I have come across in my formal studies of **'Labor'**, especially within the
historical context of the late nineteenth century through the early twentieth century. The first one is "Emma Goldman" who has been
often times called the most dangerous women in America, and the second woman is Rosa Luxemburg. The former was an "Anarchist" and
the latter was a "Marxist". Both stood for these things in a absolute sense. Both of these ladies stand head and shoulders above
such an diminutive female presence as Amy Coney Barrett, who actually betrays everything about woman hood, and a woman's reproductive
rights. Falling in line at the crack of the whip from her misogynist masters, ideologically being mounted by them at their behest.

If and when she sits on the SCOTUS, remember she speaks for no one with a vagina and ovaries. Male Republican Senator direct her when
to make judgments at their behest again. You will never rule us, and never make law for us. We will not follow or obey!

I am going to leave you here with a short video that Step Back History put out on "Emma Goldman". If you wanna really know history I cannot
recommend his channel more. As for "Rosa" we have to cover her further in an upcoming post.
