In the 20th century we saw some true patriots, that truly loved their country and also the people of their county. People that chose to **RESIST**!

So here we are at the second post:

So... ever since the Pandemic started back in Late Feb and early March, I have been strong. Mentally, physically and emotionally. From like March to May, I was practicing a "deluded" methodology of what I poorly perceived to be self-care via ingesting copious amounts of top-shelf medical grade cannabis.

Proud to say that I am 100% clean from all self-medicating coping mechanisms for a little bit more than 4 months. I'm done, forever with bud. It's a trap. That I fall for way too many times in life. I will speak more on this in the future, but for now let's move on.

So for at least a year and half now, I have been grinding away at the [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org) curriculum. [Quincy Larson](https://breakingintostartups.com/quincy-free-code-camp/), has truly built something truly amazing and concrete in order to teach software development/hacking to the masses at large... FOR FREE!!! This is in STARK CONTRAST to the weak-ticket greedy organizations such as SANS, ISC, . ***Quincy Larson wrote a piece in Medium about OpenBSD as well.*** So... we have a problem here Houston. Mr. Larson wrote this post and published it on Medium. The Title of the post was called "How I came to Love the OpenBSD Operating System". So my original intent here was to post and link directly to it. However, Medium had moved to monetize it's platform, and Mr. Larson was not down with this move. Therefore, Mr. Larson pulled all of his content and the Freecodecamp's contents off of [**Medium**](https://medium.com) quite abruptly to make a long story short. I hope I didn't miss-characterize this in any way. But here is a link on [**dev**](https://dev.to/aryanjnyc/in-defense-of-quincy-larson-and-freecodecamp-7ki) which perhaps illuminate things further. Additionally, on my first perusal of this site is amazingly kick ass. But getting back to Larson here, I believe this action speaks volumes as to his character, passion and integrity. That's my take on it anyway.

So we are like *"Dead Fucking Last"* (DFL) within the domestic talent pool of stellar performers when it comes to available professionals looking to work in the infosec industry. The Russians and Chinese basically own us, and yet... 20 years down the road organizations like [ISC2](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP#) and [SANS/GIAC](https://www.giac.org/?msc=homepage) are ***Gatekeeping*** with their out of control pricing and business (sic) models for valid industry certifications and training. And why is this? **PROFIT MARGINS**. Hopefully COVID-19 has helped them realize their mistake and they lowered their prices and yet somehow I highly doubt this.

I won't give [Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/courses-and-certifications/) or [Pentester Academy](https://www.pentesteracademy.com/pricing) any shit at all, because the ROI and absolute value added I feel is worth the price, and the price to a degree maybe expensive to some, relatively speaking it's not outrageous. If you didn't know this guy, you should... **Vivek Ramachandran** is the man behind PenTester Academy as well as the **"infamous"**
[**Security Tube**](http://securitytube.net). His contributions to teaching people to be InfoSec Professionals is immeasurable.

[So far I have completed three of their certs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/Bem0aned), but more importantly for the most part their live streams and video courses are top-notch and free.

I quite recently also successfully completed.

[![***Dr. Chuck's Python For Everybody course***](http://img.youtube.com/vi/8DvywoWv6fI/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DvywoWv6fI "")

which is worth all 13 hours. I cannot recommend this course enough.

So right now I am focusing on the following two fcc videos:

[![Data Visualization with D3 and Javascript](http://img.youtube.com/vi/_8V5o2UHG0E/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8V5o2UHG0E "")

[![DataBase Design](http://img.youtube.com/vi/ztHopE5Wnpc/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztHopE5Wnpc "")

These are both fairly long courses time wise, so be able to commit to them.

Additionally, if you're just learning python or want to sharpen your skills even further check out the following juggernauts of knowledge.

[Real Python](https://realpython.com/)

[The Python code](https://www.thepythoncode.com/)

Both of these sites are jam packed with serious knowledge to help you become a true warrior.

Also, for the better part of the last 2 months or so, I have been running Windows 10. To be quite honest
I had zero issues with it, and in some sick way I actually thought it was pretty stable. But.... I relapsed and
had to go back to BSD/Linux Operating Systems. Old habits die hard!

In all seriousness though, I thought it was really well put together, maybe if I had spent more time on it, that would have changed. Who knows....

I also acquired an account on [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/), but I have not really done much with it yet.  Again, I truly believe what *HTB* is doing is a good thing to create a robust industry of Security Professionals or Black Hats, but that's the choice of Capital now isn't it?  You should also check out [CodeDamn](https://codedamn.com/), he does charge for certain services but the cost is nominal, even on a student's budget if you ask me. Murel is a solid and sincere dude.

Until next time.

**Mask up, Glove up, Social Distance, Stay Home.**
**Or...**
**Don't do any of that and succumb to nature's "Thinning of the Herd".**

**Seriously, I mean every word of it. Do.... or just.... Die.**

*In the next posts I will talk more about things I have been up to throughout the pandemic, the protests and other aspects of the "Empires" Decline.*
