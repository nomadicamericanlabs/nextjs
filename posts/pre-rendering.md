So I have been doing blogs since either 2010-2011, the very first iterations of this was on [Blogspot](https://www.blogger.com). Since then, platform wise it evolved next to [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), and then a Static Site Generator (SSG) written by [Roman Zolotarev](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/) in ksh mainly for [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org).

I used both Pelican and Django as they were both written in [Python](https://www.python.org) which apart from [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript), is my language of choice (LOC). Pelican is a great solution for a blog. Django was a great learning process, but honestly I felt like it was too much for a blog. But it was an amazing experience from a learning standpoint. You can find everything on my [Github](http://github.com/nomadicamericanlabs) page.

I not only spent an inordinate amount of passion, time, and energy on all of these projects. I became too caught up in caring about whether of not anyone else visited the site, the amount of traffic driven to it, as well as who read the content and the actual code buildout of the blogs themselves. This was a trap for me, just like Social media platforms. To understand this, please watch ["The Social Dilemma" on Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/title/81254224) to gain more insight into this **"Trap"**.

I'm a staunch proponent of encryption, and stalwart advocate for freesoftware and privacy rights. I have been using Unix and Unix like Operating Systems since the fall of 1996. I honestly stay away from most social networking platforms as much as possible, but if I do partake in such **toxicity** from time to time, I maintain a low profile and mainly lurk.

*My passions, crafts and expertise lie within the following:
Reading, Books, Bicycles, Pizza, Bread, Cooking, Declutter, DeTrash, Politics, Music, Metal, Punk, HipHop, StraightEdge and Skateboarding/Longboarding.*

** Musically over the past couple years I have been listening to a lot *"Doom"*, **Pallbearer** definitely nails the genre.

*I approach most of the above with a DIY and function before fashion outlook.*

*I am my own historian.*

I use [EMACS](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), the [terminal](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/), and [Tiling window managers](https://www.qtile.org).

Lastly, I try very hard to promote an aesthetic that clearly reflects what I try to manifest on this site from the favicon, color schemes, fonts, and finally
the imagry itself. But I don't just spoon feed you the message. You need to figure out, the what, where and when of this image. They say that history is the
oracle of man. Sometimes the hammer of justice swings your way, the reason it swung your way is due to profound historical changes that you yourself karmically
helped to ensure manifested.

If the image disturbs you... It should and it must. Being immersed in historical denial, and profound power changes are the intervention that history brings from
time to time.

Most of all, I am just like you.

I am a human being, just an earthling above all else.

I'm your **Goldstein**.

You know what to do.
