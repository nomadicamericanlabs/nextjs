We have been baptized in shame for too many generations... **Don't beat yourself up**... It's not your fault...

**Arise\!\!**

The founder and leader of the infamous **Holy Terror** defining band known as **Integrity**, [**Dwid Hellion**](https://cvltnation.com/interview-dwid-hellion/) is a big fan of the UK Artist [**Francis Bacon**](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/26/how-dark-and-violent-fantasies-inspired-the-young-francis-bacons-art).

This video is a profoundly moving *Homage* to **Bacon**.

And for the last great seance 

We have gathered together to bring forth the End 

This is the End that shall destroy everything 

This is the night that shall forever reign 

This is the darkness that shall be your cage 

This is the chaos which shall never fade 

And they go on being mysterious 

Centuries lost in the canons of time 

They have appeared among us 

Haunting us, taunting us 

Cauldrons of infinite light 

Our dreams, they have drained us, chained us 

Left us as hollowed shell 

Tonight we shall bleed them as they have bled us before 

In a sea of blistering consciousness 

We shall arise, once again, for the End 

And testify 

Rising from Oblivion 

Only to vanish once again 

But, you never let me down did you? 

Not even when you found 

That the nightmares were here to steal your dreams away 

And replace your eyes with other things 

Like them, like me 

So hold me in your arms 

Weâ€™ll never be apart 

This darkness that I breathe 

Has ruined everything 

Lord, tell me to believe 

That this life is just a dream 

As we burn down everything
