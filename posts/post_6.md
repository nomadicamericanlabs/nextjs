# There's No Justice Here or in Poland

So now, at this very moment in history. What happens next with **ACB** being officially sworn in? Especially concerning woman's **Reproductive** rights, and the legality of Abortion. Well, if we take a look at Europe and carefully examine what is going on in Poland, you will know exactly where this goes. Not only are woman's Reproductive rights on the line here, but also the ACA, and in particular Voting rights and the Electoral process are vulnerable to some serious exploitation by a **COMPROMISED** SCOTUS. Another thing that should be on your mind, is how the courts will rule on cases concerning the **Media and Journalists**.

When I was in grade school from first through eighth grade on the East Coast in the seventies, there was a large number of families from the country of Poland. I am not positive but many of these families had fled Poland since the Blitzkrieg and then the eventual absorption into the Soviet Union in 1952. But in the 1980s following the emergence of the **"Solidarity"** movement until 1990 which led to the **dissolution of a Communist governance within Poland.**

>So... needless to say Pollacks know a teeny weeny bit, about oppression by different modalities of government. They have been fucked with... beyond the comprehension of what most of you can imagine and your first world myopic problems in this country... Until Now! For almost a little less than a century the Polish people have put up with fear and oppression that you can't even deal with. Yet they survived, mobilized, and carried out both acts direct and collective action.

Most of our Political Elites, whether Dems or GOP are so fucking full of arrogance that they think things that have occurred in Poland could never manifest themselves here. And now that brings us to this exact historical moment in time in both countries. Where I will show you the similarities. To see the irony here.

You ready? Strap yourselves in just a little tighter. Poland's current government, the **"PiS"** which literally means **"Law and Justice"** in Polish, is an almost perfect comparison of the present day United States (GOP) is and stands for.

**On October twenty fourth, the highest court ruled that Abortions due to fetal defects were in fact Unconstitutional.** This ruling has led the country and it's government to reap the whirlwind in the shape of feral violent protests in the streets against the governments and the court's decision. Oh, wait???? Wait???? Members of the GOP does this ring a bell? *Stay confident and full of hubris, please I beg you to.*

The unrest in Poland is just the pot simmering at the moment, things have not exploded yet but they will rise to a boil very soon. I guarantee it.

Some people are too busy counting their profits from bribes, and donations from the Lobbying industry to bother with history. The similarities between us and them are uncanny. **The PiS version of the Supreme court is stacked towards an ultra-right government that is truly on the verge of Authoritarianism and Fascism.**

Another thing that "Duda" and the PiS have carried out in recent months is **completely placed the media under total state control.** Do you know anyone who would desire such a thing in America?  It's probably a bit hard to recall that in the summer of this year, Trump came out and stated that US Troops would be redeployed from Germany to Poland. Awwww Yeah, you can't front on that now can you. **Trump and Duda, fascist BroMance!!!!**
