There is no excuse for not wearing a mask, and washing your hands/using purell at a minimum. But the real deal is to **SHELTER IN PLACE**\!\!\!\!\!\! You should not be going out socializing,
window shopping, having parties, going to the movies, eating out etc. WTF\!\!\!\!\! Wrong. Not now, not here\!

You should only go out for **MISSION ESSENTIAL** activities, in order to sustain you and your household in order to procure food, sundries, gas and medical supplies. Nothing else\! Why is that so hard?

**Everything is connected in the universe, this is a fact and it is not a lie.** So every time you fail to follow these simple instructions, you are not only putting yourself at
risk but also the lives of everyone in the United States, and on planet earth as a whole. Are you really that selfish and narcissistic? Please stop and think, I'm begging you.

Many of you may not know this but 675,000 Americans died during the Spanish Flu Pandemic 1918-1920. The Pandemic lasted approximately 24 months, and you can't hang with 8 months. You say you are an
American but you can't fucking hack it, whoa with your trivial first world problems.

My **Bisnonna** was approximately between the young age of 22\-24, and had my **Nonna** in 1921. Now she's a **survivor**\! An Italian immigrant that survived a calamity that killed
more people than both WWI/II combined, plus another couple of clusterfuck wars we started in the good ol' twentieth century.

Looking back, reading and researching on the Spanish Flu Pandemic we had the same amount of abject fucking stupidity then as we do now, in the twenty\-first century when humanity should be so
much further along. But no....  [**We got ignorant, traitors like Ted Cruz and his TGiving come and take it bullshit**](https://www.chron.com/coronavirus/article/Ted-Cruz-Thanksgiving-COVID-Twitter-meme-backlash-15747873.php).

Well to all of you that believe this shit is a **hoax** and you won't get sick. Guess what???? History is literally the **great Karmic Wheel processing the past, and meeting out the result of cause
and effect of ignorance.** Denial of the truth is worst kind drug of all. Junkies running dry.

In all honesty, I don't know the why of how come some of you cling so hard to this unreality. But it's your choice, and if you wanna take out yourself and your loved ones. Please do so, I will
grant that wish. But expose me or my Family or those I love... and compassion will be pretty much non existent.

I pretty much can't feel anything in that regard anymore.

And you fucking assholes in **Congress** and in the **Senate**, we best see a stimulus plan or a restructuring of the United Social Safety nets, really soon. We demand that shit, or better yet we will
take it\!\!\!\!

But me and mine, we are gonna do the right things, take proactive measures, looking out for our fellow earthlings both far and wide. We will remain, we overcome. Watch us rise\!\!\!\!\!
Nature and the universe we'll take of the rest. I don't have to do anything, you will ensure your demise.

So... again to reiterate

**SHELTER IN PLACE**


and...

**LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE**
