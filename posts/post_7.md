So I am reading the [**Treasury of the True Dharma Eye: Zen Master Dogen's ShoboGenzo**](https://www.amazon.com/Treasury-True-Dharma-Eye-Master/dp/1590309359/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=shobogenzo&qid=1604169035&sr=8-2)

Caveat: I am merely a lay person who practices Zen Buddhism with a local sangha, I do NOT portend to have any sort of Kensho. I have not formally taken the 8 precepts either, I do not have nor created a Rakasu. I do however belong to a
Zen sangha that meets for Zazen regularly. I do try very hard to practice the precepts to the best of my ability, seek refuge in my Sangha as well as the Buddha and the Dharma. I felt very strongly that I need to read this book with
a sense of urgency in these crucial times. It is a vast and formidable undertaking but I am committed to seeing it through.

At this time I am in the midst of trying to digest the 9th Fascicle entitled **"Receiving the Marrow by Bowing"**. The Shasta Abbey provides the [**"ShoboGenzo"**](https://www.shastaabbey.org/pdf/shoboAll.pdf) free of charge.

In this post what I have done is gleaned out excerpts from this particular fascicle that have moved me deeply. Then below them, I give a brief commentary on how I understand or do not understand them. These are my interpretations only. At their very best they are infantile but I have the humility for strong critiques of this work.

> *"In the practice of the unsurpassable, complete enlightenment, what is most
difficult is to find a guiding teacher. The guiding teacher should be a strong
person, regardless of being a male or female. The teacher should be a person of
thusness, with excellent knowledge and wild fox \[transformative\] spirit, whether
living in the past or present. This is the face \[essence\] of attaining the marrow, the guiding virtue. This is "not ignoring cause and effect," and "You and I are just this.""*

I feel that these lines reinforce that absolute necessity of trying not to completely "go it alone" when it comes to Zen, an the extreme import of having a teacher and engaging in dokusan with your teacher. Also you need to ensure that you are following an authentic teacher, sex of this person is not an issue. The genuine authenticity is what is of importance.

> *"Practice with heart, practice with beyond heart, practice even with half a heart. In this way, brush off the fire on your head \[practice with urgency\], or stand on your toes \[practice intensely\]."*

I honestly believe that it is so important to practice with a complete sense of urgency. Don't put your practice off. The time is now. Right now. Right this second is the time to practice.


> *"If you practice in this way, you will not be destroyed by jealous demons; the ancestor [Huike] who cut off his arm and attained the \[Bodhidharma's\] marrow becomes not other \[than you\]. The master who drops away body and mind is you yourself."*

As [**Bassui**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bassui_Tokush%C5%8D) said, to always ask yourself continuously **"Who is the Master".** I honestly try to truly believe these words. Anytime even for a microsecond during zazen, kinhin or other parts of our daily lives, where we let go in order to drop away the mind and body we can become "Huike". If I can't believe this, then why practice?

> *"You attain the marrow and are invariably transmitted dharma through your utmost **sincerity** and trusting heart. There is no path that comes from anything other than sincere trust; there is no direction that emerges from itself."*

In my mind throughout my life, even before I was exposed to Zen Buddhism. I always believed that **sincerity** is one of the most important character traits or attributes of a person's persona that truly show their love and humility toward others and towards their work ethics.

> *"You retreat from the world and make the way your abode."*

As a earthling who for long persistent lengths of time has dealt with PTSD as well OCD, I have in the past, present and possibly the future, always been sort of a loner, outlier or isolationist. At times this could be stated that I used this mode of limiting social interaction as a not so good form of coping. But over the past 2-3 years, I have come to the conclusion that being alone is not the same as being lonely. No matter what I do, I am always connected and plugged in. To believe otherwise is delusive. I am making small but sure steps along a straight line to be on the "way".

> *"If you encounter someone who maintains the great dharma, having received the acknowledgment\--"You have attained my marrow"\-- whether the person is a pillar or a lantern, a Buddha, wild fox, demon, man or woman, you keep your body and mind on the zazen seat and attend to the person even for immeasurable eons.*"

> *"But it is rare to encounter dharma.*"

So possibly this is where it gets weird or "wrong", but I really do honestly believe that "Buddha Nature" exists in everything. Not just sentient beings. So, it doesn't what it is, animate or inaminate, or what forms manifest or possess the dharma, if they possess the dharma authentically. Then they have the ability to be a great teacher of the Dharma. Just stay focused on your practice and attend to your Dharma teachers consistently.

At this point in the reading Dogen writes about what "Shakyamuni Buddha" directly had to say about it.

>>  # *"Shakyamuni Buddha said:"*

>> "*Bow and pay respect to them three times a day, and do not arouse the mind of confusion."*

Performing Gassho to your dharma teachers, aids immensely in keeping your mind focused on the present moment, just as with Zazen or Kinhin. 

>> *"If you act in this way, the path of enlightenment will certainly have a place."*

To perform Gassho consistently in your life towards a myriad of sentient beings and things will ensure your way along the path.

>> *"Thus, look to trees and rocks, fields and villages, to expound dharma. This fox was known as a great boddhisattva. This action by Indra was not based on the fox's high or low status of being."*

Again, as I have said previously, I believe all things in the Universe can provide us with dharma lessons.

>> *"However, foolish people who have not heard Buddha dharma call themselves great monks and would not bow to younger ones who have attained dharma. Those who have matured practice over a long period of time would not bow to latecomers who have attained dharma. Those who have certificates as masters would not bow to others who have not been certified."*

We let our minds tell us stories that we start clinging to, get stuck with, or addicted to and coupled with our dualistic thinking leads to an attitude of Arrogance and classfullness. Perhaps in some way this is an actual breaking of
the precepts on a certain level as well. This is not in accordance with the practice of Zen. But to some degree for all us, sometimes this can be hard, at least on the inside, and in unspoken terms.

>> *"Boddhisattva of three classes and ten stages would not bow to nuns who have attained dharma."*

There  was a time in Japan when there serious discrimination against the role of women within the Soto Zen sect. Perhaps, there still is to varying degrees. This saddens me greatly, if it still true. But I know I have the resource to ask
this question directly to many female Roshis and Nuns.

>> *"Such foolish people have neither seen nor heard the Buddha way, just like the one who groundlessly left parents and wandered another land."*

It seems to me that Shakyamuni is referring to people that leave home when they are still somewhat immature or naive about being out on their own in the world.

>> *"How should the authentic dharma of all Buddhas not have compassion to respond to **sincere** hearts?"* *"Even mud, rocks, sand, and pebbles have hearts to be affected by **sincerity**"*

The Buddha is telling us that authentic dharma is directly related to sincerity in order transmit and receive it and that everything in the Universe is endowed with **Heart** to be affected by it.

>> *"Why are men special? Emptiness is emptiness"*

>> *"Do not discriminate between men and woman"*

This is regarding one of the core themes of this fascicle. Addressing the misogyny within the Soto sect.
We have to leg go of dualistic thinking in terms of the genders regarding all beings.

>> *"They should also do so to accomplished women and even to animals"*

I know the topic of veganism is and can be controversial, but I truly believe that this speaks directly to the topic as well.

>> "*This is an authentic custom of the Buddha way. Those who do not know this custom and do not receive it should be pitied"*

This points to **Gassho**, and to the core importance of it within our practice, and to practice it in our daily lives not
just in council, Kinhin, or Zazen. But in our everyday interactions within the community and our families.

>> # **Dogen's Postscript**

>> *"Not to revere you own unsurpassable enlightenment is to foolishly slander dharma."*

This is akin to forgiving others but not forgiving yourself, or how can you love another being but not your own self. You must revere you own *sincere* efforts of
Zazen as well other parts of your practice daily! If you don't do this, you inadvertently slander dharma.

>> *"If you do so, grass, trees, and walls will give out true dharma, all things in heaven and earth will offer true dharma".*

Again, it is reiterated that everything is a potential dharma teacher that is quite capable of teaching you lessons of true dharma.
**Even Walls.**

>> *"At the time of becoming free from delusion and realizing the truth, there is no difference between men and women."*

Dogen states here literally that men and women or equal in the absolute sense.

>> The farther away you push objects, the deeper you may be attached to them.

The more you push objects away, perhaps you push them away from you because you know or have a fear that you are very attached to them.

Within the context of this fascicle's postscript as a whole Dogen takes a deep dive into to subjects regarding Zen nuns. Many
Zen practitioners make unnecessary vows that are bound to "sexual" ideas and mistake them for issues regarding the problem of "gender" in
Zen. He also, talks at length about a Japanese cultural tradition regarding a "secluded" practice space, that was apparently off limits
to nuns. These are also problems that only amplified the issues of sexism within Soto Zen at that time in Japan. It limits the spreading of the dharma.

In totality, the core elements in the 9th fascicle are (sincerity, respect and humility) which are expressed via **Gassho**, sexism, as well
as the importance of a Teacher in your Zen practice at all junctures along the path lest you get stuck.

We have come the end of this post, and I do sincerely hope, that these comments regarding this fascicle do not render me as a "Rambling"
lunatic or broken earthling. This all comes directly from my heart and mind, with which I am finally starting to learn to trust.

This post represents only myself, it does **NOT** represent my sangha, it's members or our **Roshis**.

With all my being I dedicate this post to my my Sangha, my Sangha's Sangha, and lastly my great teacher **Roshi Merle "Kyodo" Boyd**.

**Gassho**

>> **"While they rested in the evening, they discussed the story about the wind and the banner of Huineng, High Ancestor of Caoxi. The seventeen monks' interpretations were all wrong."**

>> **"They got formally dressed, offered incense, bowed, and asked her to teach. Miaoxin said, "Come closer""**

>> **"When the seventeen monks were still getting closer, Miaoxin said, "It is not the wind flaps. It is not that the banner flaps. It is not that your mind flaps."**
