When I first purchased and downloaded this book to my kindle, I honestly bought it because of it's title, and I didn't think for one second about the author at all. I was completely oblivious to who he or she was  at the time
because I was so utterly "enamored" with it's title. I had recently read [**"How Fascism Works" by Jason Stanley**](https://www.npr.org/2020/11/21/937638178/-how-fascism-works-author-on-trump-s-attempts-to-overturn-election-results)  and although it was a good book, and there were many good things I learned, something felt missing but I can't put a finger on it.

When I started to read [**White Trash**](http://www.nancyisenberg.com/white-trash), I realized this was a literal scholarly treatise on class in the United States. The preface itself took forever to finish before I arrived at the first chapter.

**The bottom line is this... this book profoundly changed my life, perhaps even more so than [A Peoples History of The United States by the late great Howard Zinn](https://www.howardzinn.org/bibliography/books/peoples-history/). So let's finally talk about the author in question,
[Nancy Isenberg](https://www.lsu.edu/hss/history/people/faculty/isenberg.php). She has a Doctorate in History and has written other historical books prior to this gem. Additionally, she is also a Rutgers Alumni and received here B.A. in History there in 1980.**

[Kevin .D Williamson, a 'roving' correspondent  of the The National Review reviewed this book](https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/08/white-trash-review-nancy-isenbergs-new-book-bad-history/), and all I can say is. I can't do anything for this guy, I cant help him. Sadly his mind is riddled with delusions of hate, and writes for a periodical that is full of disinformation and distorted flawed ideologies.

**Prior** to the writing of United States Constitution, this nation inherited a flawed and malignant cornucopia of ideologies from the very nation it claimed it was leaving and fighting a revolution for.
These ideas spread from the likes of Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin. They inherited these ideas from well known Elizabethan influences as [**John Locke**](https://www.johnlocke.org/about-john-locke/who-is-john-locke/) and [**Richard Haklyut**](https://www.hakluyt.com/).

For a very long time I loved to bandy about the phrase **"It's not Race War, it's a Class War"**. I guess to degree this book kind reinforces and solidifies this expression. But I want to expand upon that.

Class War and Race War are intricately intertwined, just as Labor and Capital are intertwined. When this Nation was created, many in power at the time, made sure that even 244 years later, we would believe otherwise. These Myths were codified 244 years ago, and apparently we still believe them. Like Junkies running dry. We are formally indoctrinated to buy into these myths, hook, line and sinker since kindergarten. There are some though who can fortunately see through their lies.

They want you to believe in the "Land Of Opportunity" where it is a "Equal Playing Field", and that we are a **CLASSLESS society**, but it's a **myth**. It's ironic that **Marx** too, wrote about a CLASSLESS society and he meant it, it is not supposed to be a myth. **That was not what Marx proposed in his years of writing and systematic analysis of the UNSUSTAINABLE beast known as capitalism.**

Both Race and Class War converge, pushed by the natural forces of man's inherently natural Labor Power and the unnatural synthetic forces of Capital (Adam Smith).
Sexism/Misogyny/Patriarchical force themselves into the fray as well as eugenics, and they are riding in an Apocalyptic horse drawn carriage right behind Labor and Capital.

This book immediately begins to disabuse the reader of the **MYTH** of opportunity for all, and a **proxy classless** country right away by pushing you into a corner. In the succeeding chapters it starts taking swings that pummeling you in the gut, head and face. In the conclusion it knocks you out, and you hit the concrete. Upon awakening you are confronted by a concrete foundation of fastidious empirical data, that you can't overlook or disprove.

*Below you will find my most favorite under\-girding quotes from this fine piece of historical literature:*

>**Poor whites are still taught to hate \-\- but not to hate those who are keeping them in line.**

>Lyndon Johnson knew this when he quipped, **"If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man,
he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you."** p. 264

>**The sad fact is, if we have no class analysis, then we will continue to be shocked at the numbers of waste people who inhabit what self\-annointed patriots have style the "greatest civilization in the history of the world"**
p. 309

>In Thomas Jefferson's formulation, nature assigned classes. Nature demanded a natural aristocracy\-\-what he termed *"accidental aristoi."*
The spark of **lust** would direct the strong to breed with the strong, the "good and wise" to marry for beauty, health, virtue and talents
\-\- traits that would be bred forward. p. 316

>Marriage has always been connected to class status: today's online dating services are premised on the eugenic notion that a person can
find a perfect match\-\-a match presumed to be based on shared class and educational interests. p. 316

>Poor women lost state-funded abortions during the **Carter years**, and today they are proscribed from using **welfare funds to buy disposable diapers. **To modern conservatives, women are first and foremost breeders. This was tellingly displayed during the Republican primary debates in 2012, when candidates boasted about the size of their families, each trying to outdo the last, as the camera panned across the podium.** p. 318

>**The poor can starve “a little,” says [Charlotte Hays](https://thefederalist.com/author/charlottehays/), and there are surely others who feel the same way. The innocuous-sounding term “fertility treatment” enables the wealthy to breed their own kind, buying sperm and eggs at “baby centers” around the country.** p. 318

>**Some things never change. More than one generation has deluded itself by buying into the notion of an American dream. A singular faith exists today that is known and embraced as American exceptionalism, but it dates back centuries to the projections made and policies put in place when the island nation of Great Britain began to settle the American continent. It was Richard Hakluyt’s fantastic literature that graduated to a broader colonial drive for continental domination.** p. 318

>**Antiabortion activists, like eugenicists, think that the state has the right to intervene in the breeding habits of poor single women.** p. 318

>**If the American dream were real, upward mobility would be far more in evidence.** p. 319

>Historically, Americans have confused social mobility with physical mobility. The class system tracked across the land with the so-called pioneering set. We need to acknowledge that fact. Generally, it was the all-powerful speculators who controlled the distribution of good land to the wealthy and forced the poor squatter off his land. Without a visible hand, markets did not at any time, and do not now, magically pave the way for the most talented to be rewarded; the well connected were and are preferentially treated. p. 319

>**Pretending that America has grown rich as a largely classless society is bad history, to say the least.** p. 320

>The “1 percent” is the most recently adopted shorthand for moneyed monopoly, bringing attention to the ills generated by consolidated power, but the phenomenon it describes is not new. **Class separation is and has always been at the center of our political debates, despite every attempt to hide social reality with deceptive rhetoric.** The white poor have been with us in various guises, as the names they have been given across centuries attest: Waste people. Offscourings. Lubbers. Bogtrotters. Rascals. Rubbish. Squatters. Crackers. Clay-eaters. Tackies. Mudsills. Scalawags. Briar hoppers. Hillbillies. Low-downers. **White niggers.** Degenerates. White trash. Rednecks. Trailer trash. Swamp people. p. 320

>**But today’s trailer trash are merely yesterday’s vagrants on wheels, an updated version of Okies in jalopies and Florida crackers in their carts.** p. 320

>They are renamed often, but **they do not disappear. Our very identity as a nation, no matter what we tell ourselves, is intimately tied up with the dispossessed. We are, then, not only preoccupied with race, as we know we are, but with good and bad breeds as well. It is for good reason that we have this preoccupation: by calling America not just “a” land of opportunity but “the” land of opportunity, we collectively have made a promise to posterity that there will always exist the real potential of self-propulsion upward.** p. 320

>**The discomfort middle\-class Americans feel when forced to acknowledge the existence of poverty highlights the disconnect between image and reality.** p. 321

*Audio wise I think this song sums up the book in the tersest manner possible*

In all honesty I could go on forever about the book, the United States and Class in general, but it's time to wrap things up. I truly hope you enjoyed it.

Be Well and always practice self-care with a clear mind.
