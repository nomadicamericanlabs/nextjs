In the waning days of the Pacific Campaign of World War Two, some [**3000 Americans lost their lives**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iwo_Jima#Battle_of_Iwo_Jima) fighting against the Fascistic Empire of Japan in order to secure the island of IwoJima. They fought fiercely, both tooth and nail, to raise the American Flag on the top of Mount Suribachi to show that American Values flew straight in the face of Tyrants, Fascists and Thugs throughout the World. Over the last twenty years or so a pernicious fascist movement has been metastasizing across my great nation as an alternative solution to why the country has sunk into a quagmire of mediocrity mainly due to predatory capitalism. I passionately need to see what my nation is yet to become in all it's love and goodness. Those of my country  men and women who voted POTUS 45 into office, are outright traitors to this country and GUILTY of treason. The 45th POTUS and his supporters are directly responsible for the subversion and the theft of the American Flag and overtly transforming it into a cheapened veneer of Nationalized hate and ignorance. This will end. We are taking our flag and national symbols back, and this will occur in a very palpable fashion. Your are forewarned. In a nutshell, [**by default if your were born on American soil you are an AntifA member**](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/protest-arrests-show-regular-americans-urban-antifa-73709791), simple as that, unless you decide to commit treason against this country's inherent values. Love is louder than bombs or fists, and bullets.

I guess that right after the towers fell we saw a steep rise in the fetishism of American symbols of national pride commandeered, and manifested into a fetish object that organically symbolized that fear and reflected it back
onto and draped over the American populace's tallow faces in a way that we had never seen before. The symbol here was the central symbolic representation of everything the United States supposedly ever stood for in the sense of our
values as a people. Perhaps that was a lie that had already been perpetrated as a myth long before I was born. But let's stick to the 21st century here. Maybe I could even give Dubya's Administration the benefit of the doubt here, and
maybe they really were sincerely trying on a certain level to Unite the Country through one of it's darkest hours. But... wait a minute, Giuliani was there back then too.

Remember when the new rallying cry was "Either your with us or Against US"? Or when "French" fries, became "Freedom Fries"? Don't... ever forget that. Within the that year, I witnessed many suburban neighborhoods in many different states, in
many different regions of this country I love so much start displaying numerous flags in each yard. Also, many Auto Dealers started flying amazingly enormous sized American Flags out of the blue. Now since 2016-2020 with the election of the 45th POTUS, we literally have people that over glorify and fetishize old glory to the point of disgust. People with 20 plus American Flags in their yards, some whom have zero people in the any part of their families that served this
country in any way shape or form. People who know nothing about the proper handling, display or care for the flag. Citizens that are blinded by Nationalistic semiotics and literally purchased flags that were made in China or any other nation with horrific human rights records and instability. As long as it's a flag.

Many of my fellow Americans have this myopic and lapidary perspective of Patriotism, that the more American flags you have displayed physically, it is a sign of concrete empirical evidence that somehow they served and protected this
great land and it's DIVERSE population. This melting pot of diligence, and resilience. This is at best a cognitive distortion, and at it's worst outright treason!

In the four chambers of my Heart, I would love to literally annihilate the semiotics and symbology that are used today in the post modern world at large. Mainly, political and religious as well. Even to some degree, symbols of consumerism, capitalism, Marxism and pop culture as well. When your critical thinking fails to look beyond and behind what a symbol stands for, or if the symbol has been hijacked, maligned or defiled to suit a malicious intent and you don't question it. Then you my friend become the problem, and a true enemy of mankind across the universe. Check yourself. Now.

I am your Goldstein. Cast off your chains!!!

>There’s a parallel to be found in the Blue Lives Matter flag, the American one drained of all color but for a blue stripe across the middle, the police (and their grievances) centered as the essence of American identity. That flag, the> man who made it, Andrew Jacob, previously told me, was created in response to Black Lives Matter. The black below the blue, Jacob said—half the flag—“represents criminals.” It’s an American flag that divides the nation into us and the>m, or, as Trump might put it, “our people” and “animals.”

>The rising visibility of white nationalist groups, and fascism’s return to the public eye both in the US and in Europe more generally, however has brought to the fore more menacing symbols of the (ancient) past. The word “fascism” itse>lf, like its Italian progenitor fascismo, derives from the Latin for “bundle of sticks.” And while it may seem an odd and benign symbol, that bundle — or fasces as it was called (in the Greek, ῥάβδοι) — carried significant political an>d cultural weight, as well as the threat of violence. In the center of the bundle of rods a small axe was kept in case capital punishment had to be carried out.

> Mussolini’s approach to politics is an extreme example of the degrading process aesthetics underwent at the turn of the twentieth century, a most perniciously successful implementation of the aestheticization of politics.
