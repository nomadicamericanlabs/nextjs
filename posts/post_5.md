Well now we are down to the wire, and confidence level is high, that
shit is gonna get seriously real now. We arrived at the demarcation of the
point of no return. Make no mistake about it.

 [**Brian Goh wrote a guest piece in the NYT entitled "The Radicalization
of a Small American Town"**](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/opinion/trump-country-2020-election.html), that paints the state of the National Consciousness, or the lack thereof quite poignantly for us all. To include the fact that we just went over 81K Covid cases in a single day.

[**Lizzie Widdcombe penned another NYT piece entitled "What can you do if Trump Stages a Coup?"**](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/what-can-you-do-if-trump-stages-a-coup/). Yo!! Never say never, and ***STAND BY***.

So in the interim, ***"Keep Calm and Carry On"***. Stay in the **moment**, stay ***Resilient***. We got this.
I am your Goldstein always, and it is now truly time to... ***"Cast off those chains!!!"***.

***Love, Passion and Urgency!!!!***
