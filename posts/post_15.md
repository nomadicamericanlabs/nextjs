	**Mourning** **Sorrow** 

This mourning sorrow has finally eroded the sole

But I must keep pushing onward through all this psychic wreckage

Even though I am getting so perilously close to the fucking edge

Of this depressive hole

In my mind In my mind In my fucking mind!!!!

Living in real time, live streaming the destruction

Of everything I was supposed to ever stand for, I want to turn my back, I can leave it all behind

This anxiety has too much suction

Clawing viciously at my bearing and positve mental outlook

If there ever was a time to stop and be still in this very moment

Instructions for the cook!!!

listen listen and try...  allow peace to foment

listen, listen,
look, look

whatever my come
do not succumb

I will walk to the very end
and I will get in that boat
where everything lets go and I can mend
where I formlessly float as one

I wrote this approximately sometime in mid March to mid Apr of 2020. In the first months of
the pandemic. I was seriously depressed and "Doom" scrolling. I had just gotten high af on
some cannabis, and half-assedly attempted to do Zazen.

Im starting to rethink my writing of prose and poetry after a long while.

It's been a while. I came out the other side of the pandemic and post Trump administration a
better being. At least I would like to think so. Now Ukraine, but I'm not "Doom" scrolling this,
I will be present for it.
