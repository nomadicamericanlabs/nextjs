Following the 2020 general election, we have come to another fork in the road on this journey to what this great nation
can do to improve itself. It is a time to reflect and begin to rebuild. Many of us, have a lot of deep seated anger and  disgust that is
nailed to a canvas of abject national betrayal. **Many of us.... including some of the most grounded and peace loving minds
are having a  hard time overcoming our anger filled thoughts and emotions.** Sometimes in these cases we look to the past,
in some very obscure back alleys of history that occurred on an almost alien continent to many Americans.

In this instance may I direct your attention to the following slice of the history of the African country of Mozambique, and
one of it's famous leaders, **Samora Machel**. Samora was a fascinating leader and I urge you to learn more about him but what I want to focus directly upon is his actions as the President of
Mozambique following it's independence from the European country of Portugal in July of 1975. Prior to this Mozambique was a Portuguese
colonial territory. Portugal governed Mozambique with an iron fist and a legacy of brutality during it's rule of the colony.

Following Mozambique's independence, in 1982 Samora Machel established a week long meeting that was dubbed [**"The Meeting of the Compromised"**](http://www.mozambiquehistory.net/comprometidos.php). Biden and Harris, have more than enough on their collective plates and their work cut out for them. Perhaps more so, than any other President and Vice President collectively in America's history, **surpassing even the national burdens that Abraham Lincoln had to shoulder or FDR by any means.** Trump, his administration, the GOP as well as his supporting base have exponentially inflamed the real time nation crises even further following his **election loss.**

**Although, at least in a precursory manner it seems as if the incoming Administration would like to possibly show an egregious sense of compassion and forgiveness in order to satisfy the urgent national need for Unity.** These efforts must me met and tempered with direct actions at national level that ensure accountability at all levels for every single citizen that engaged in traitors actions in order to destabilize and delegitimize our Democracy. There can be no compromise and no pardons whatsoever. **Failing to do will only ensure that the wounds will fester and remain open and this great republic will surely self-destruct akin to a Celtic snake eating it's own tail. Like a junkie running dry.**

Ironically, outside of this documentary, which itself was created by Mozambique National Institute of Cinematography. In a Wikipedia entry on Samora Machel both **"Geoff Hill" and "Peter Worthington"** cited FRELIMO as being collectively responsible for illegal prison camps and the deaths of 30K inmates. They do not however classify as to whether or not the inmates were "Compromised" or just "criminals". However I cannot find any empirical data on either author or the claims that they make. **Either way, the only event I am focusing on here is that of the "Meeting of the Compromised" or as they say it "comprometidos". At least in my mind, we need to strike a balance with real concrete action as a nation on both holding the "Traitors" accountable for their actions, admitting their guilt, prosecution and if at all possible rehabilitation and reintegration into the fabric of our nation. **If not they must be convicted and remanded over to the bureau of federal prisons. These prisons are not to be facilities that are regarded as those for "White Collar Crime" felons.**

If this disturbs you or angers you to violence or violent thought processes so be it. All parties cited above have committed high crimes against the state, cultivating a climate of both fear and hatred.

My stance on this stands. I urge all of you, don't wast time, watch the documentary pay attention to all the details, and draw your own conclusions.

La Lucha Continuea!!!!
